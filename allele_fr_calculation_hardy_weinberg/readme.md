Here you find scripts for
- calculating allele frequencies for each of the inversion (assuming each arrangment to be an allele)
- creating a table with inversions, their frequencies and if the fr is majour, minor or a product of further recombination and out of those categories 
- calculating deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equlibrium for each of inversion regions in a sample and also in groups (South, North, Polish populations)
