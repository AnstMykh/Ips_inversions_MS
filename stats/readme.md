Here you can find scripts for a various satistical analysis we have performed including:

- ./ORs (olfactory receptors) enrichment analysis + coordinates of inversions in .bed, coordinates of ORs in .bed, contig sizes in bp (only 26 contigs included, see the manuscript) .bed
   
- LD (linkage disequilibrium) estimations per contig. First estimated using PLINK and later summerized in 10K windows in R
