# Ips_inversions_MS

This repository provides scripts associated with the publication "Complex Genomic Landscape of Inversion Polymorphism in Europeâ€™s Most Destructive Forest Pest." These scripts are designed for a detailed description of the genomic landscape of Ips typographus, the spruce bark beetle. The scripts cover:

- Genome-wide genetic variation and its geographic structuring

- Identification of inversions, including their geographic distribution and variation patterns

- Enrichment testing of Gene Ontology (GO) terms within inversions

- Estimation of mutation load

- Testing for phenotype-genotype associations, specifically the presence of olfactory receptor genes within inverted regions

- Genotype-environment association (GEA) analyses




More detailed descriptions are available within each dedicated folder.
